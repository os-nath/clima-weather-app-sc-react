Clima

ðŸ’¡ What is Clima?

This is a Weather app developed by me as the final project of the SheCodes Plus using HTML, CSS and JS languages.
I named my weather app as Clima and created the logo below:

Clima is capable of searching for any city in the world and display its current weather as well as 6 days forecast.
It is composed of a search engine, API integration, wind speed, weather description, weather icons, 6 days forecast, Celsius and Fahrenheit unit conversion for the current weather.

ðŸ¤¸ Getting Started

ðŸ’¾ Installation

1. go to my GitHub public repository and clone the project's URL
2. Inside your terminal run git clone + paste the URL just cloned
3. as it's the first time the project was pulled, run yarn install to download all needed items and packages.
4. Run code .
5. Run yarn start to view the project on your browser.




# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
